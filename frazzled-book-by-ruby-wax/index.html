<p><strong>Frazzled Book By Ruby Wax</strong>, Drawing on insights from her inspiring new book. Waxs story sections spattered throughout Frazzled were fascinating to read. So my apologies for not being able to sum up this book in a single clever sentence. In Frazzled Wax uses her not inconsiderable wit and outspokenness to share her thoughts on mindfulness which she grounds not in the realms of vegetarian cushions but in her own newly gathered academic expertise on the human brain.</p>

<p>Its an easy-to-understand introduction to mindfulness weaved together with Rubys trademark wit and humour. We might have evolvedto be able to miraculously balance on seven-inch heels but as far as our emotional development is concerned were still swimming with the pond scum. Our story The inspiration for Frazzled Cafe came from our founder and patron Ruby Waxs experiences during her best-selling book and theatre tours. Showing 19 distinct works.</p>

<p>We open and close our meetings with a brief mindfulness exercise to help everyone to be present in the room but it is not the main focus of Frazzled Cafe meetings. Foibles aside Wax is undoubtedly sincere in her avowal of the positive outcomes that can arise once you commit yourself to mindfulness. This makes the book all the more personal and perhaps shows in that the latter section of the book seems to me a bit less dynamic or humorous than the first.
