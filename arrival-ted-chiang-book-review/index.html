<p>A swell movie adaptation always sends me to the source material so Arrival had me pick up Ted Chiangs Stories of Your Life and Others. Arrival is a 2016 American science fiction drama film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted by Eric Heisserer who conceived the project as a spec script based on the 1998 short story Story of Your Life by Ted ChiangThe film stars Amy Adams as Louise Banks a linguist enlisted by the United States Army to discover how to communicate with extraterrestrial aliens who have arrived on Earth. Includes Story Of Your Life the basis for the major motion picture Arrival starring Amy Adams Forest Whitaker Jeremy Renner and directed by Denis Villeneuve. His style of writing in the collection is precise and straightforward almost distant. Book Review Ted Chiang Uses Sci Fi To Present A Nuanced Understanding Of Our Own Selves.</p>
