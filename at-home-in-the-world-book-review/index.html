<p>At Home in the World is absolutely beautiful. Which reality is truer is up to the readers interpretation. Although 90 min is barely enough to narrate the story in its emotional complexity the movie is very faithful to the book probably because the screenplay is from Cunningham himself. The homes that Anita visited certainly dont look like the kind of homes that you would find on the pages of interiors magazines. It deals with writer Joyce Maynards affair with JD Salinger at eighteen and how his influence and ultimately his abandonment of her completely brutal and heartless shaped not only her life for years to come but affected everything else her.</p>
