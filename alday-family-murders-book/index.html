<p>The author didnt allow his opinion to influence the story hence both sides of the story were told. In 1973 fugitives committed one of the worst massacres in Georgiathe Alday murders. Dead were 62-year-old Ned Alday his sons Jerry Aubrey Jimmy and Shuggie Chester plus daughter-in-law Mary wife of Jerry. The stars are for the patience time and devotion to the Alday family of Thomas Cook and the writing. Brothers In Blood The True Account Of The Georgia Massacre By Clark Howard.</p>

<p>Of course the author also shows great deal more empathy to the Alday family whose tragic losses remind me of Holocaust survivors who have learned that their families were murdered. Today marks forty two years and two months since what was described as one of Georgias worst crimes. Dead were 62-year-old Ned Alday his sons Jerry Aubrey Jimmy and Shuggie Chester plus daughter-in-law Mary wife of Jerry. Isaacs now 36 had testified for the prosecution that the four had driven to the Alday home looking for money and drugs and were interrupted in their attempted burglary by returning family members.
