<p>This book follows the evidence for Asclepius supplicants from the moment in which they realized that they were sick until the healing experiences which they might have had at the asclepieia. The Greek original lost since classical times is thought to date from the 2nd or 3rd century AD. It seems to be written more to engage the interest and enthusiasm than to provide concrete history. The Asclepius is one of two philosophical books ascribed to the legendary sage of Ancient Egypt Hermes Trismegistus who was believed in classical and renaissance times to have lived shortly after Moses.
