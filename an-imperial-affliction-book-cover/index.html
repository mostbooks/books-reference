<p>An Imperial Affliction is Hazel Graces favorite book because of the parallels she draws between its lead character and herself. My name is Anna. The cover has been painstakingly recreated in high-quality crisp graphics using a genuine prop which was used for filming as a reference to make this as close to the screen used book as possible. Im sixteen years old and I have cancer. Pin On My Posh Closet.</p>
