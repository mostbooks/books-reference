<p>The answer which applies to every book on mathematics and in particular to this one can be given in one wordactively. A book of abstract algebra Charles C. It introduces rings before groups theyre usually done the other way around but since were generally more familiar with rings it felt like a somewhat logical progression. Im only familiar with two Abstract Algebra books but heres my take on them.</p>
