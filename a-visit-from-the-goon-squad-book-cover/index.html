<p>A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music about survival about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. Many of the stories reference the absence of the twin towers and several stories nod to the fear of future acts of terrorism depicting the heightened state of surveillance Americans have. It is stark simple and manages to convey with the wild guitar strings that the book will be somehow all over the place.

<p>Her 2002 cover story on homeless children received the Carroll Kowal Journalism Award and her 2008 story on bipolar children won an Outstanding Media Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. For a book so relentlessly savvy about the digital age and its effect on how we experience time speeded up herky-jerky instantaneous but also full of unbearable gaps and pauses A Visit From the Goon Squad is remarkably old-fashioned in its obsession with times effects on characters that preoccupation of those doorstop 19th-century novels. For each quote you can also see the other characters and themes related to it each theme is indicated by its own dot and icon like this one. Her stories have been published in The New Yorker Harpers Magazine GQ Zoetrope All-Story and Ploughshares and her nonfiction appears frequently in The New York Times Magazine. As it is a new literary work there has not been a lot of analysis done on it to date in other words there is a gap in the literature and this essay will attempt to close some of that gap.</p>
