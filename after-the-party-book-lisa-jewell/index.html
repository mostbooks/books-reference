<p>Lisa Jewell is a British author of popular fiction. Lisa Jewells writing is like a big warm hug. The prequel is light-hearted and fun but After the Party is the book that I really wanted to read with its blunt unromanticised exploration of the modern couple and a very real insight into what happens after the fairytale ends. After eleven years together Ralph and Jem realise that their relationship has reached rock bottom and something has to change or it may be over.
