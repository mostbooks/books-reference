<p>Sadly Im very honest and I cant rate this 55. About a Boy is a book that Ive dreamed about - a meaningful book about human relationships as opposed to adventures that is to the point and not chock full of rambling and embellishing imagery. Analysis Chapter 5 Analysis Chapter 5 021111 The fifth chapter of the novel About A Boy from Nick Hornby published in 1998 is about Marcus a 12-year-old boy and his problems at home and in school. Marcus tells Will about Ellie and Zoe and Will can see that the boy may have feelings for Ellie and tries to tell him that a fifteen-year-old girl would not go out with a twelve-year-old boy.
