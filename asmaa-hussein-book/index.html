<p>All our books feature Muslim characters and protagonists because we believe representation matters. Asmaa tells us her story through diary entries of how she met and lost her husband. I really take my hat off to Asmaa Hussein for writing and publishing books like this one and like Bismillah Soup that give children the chance to experience another culture through a book. Diversity in childrens literature contributes to a solid character education and seeing. Robot Check Great Books To Read Books To Read Online Books To Read.</p>
