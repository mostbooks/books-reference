<p>Subsidiary rights are negotiable in a book contract and will cover such potentially valuable rights as movie film videotape and audiotape rights electronic rights such as CD ROM publishing translation rights book club rights foreign rights etc. However even in a non-fiction context acquiring the story rights may be a way to obtain cooperation from the author of a published work or the individual whose life story you want to use.
