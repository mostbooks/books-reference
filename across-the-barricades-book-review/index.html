<p>I think the language is easy to understand most times it can be hard when they start to use Irish phrases or speak slang. I had to read this book when I was in High School and I remember I loved it I recently found out there are other books in this series I always thought it was just the one book so I have my local library searching for copies of the rest of the books in this series for now I am reading Across The Barricades again the funny thing is my husband said he also read this.
