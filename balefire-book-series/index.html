<p>However Ill try not to give too much away in case you want to hunt down the original volumes A Chalice of Wind A Circle of Ashes A Feather of Stone and A Necklace of Water. A Circle of Ashes. Book of Shadows is the first novel of the Sweep series of novels by Cate Tiernan. But when I decided to order the Balefire series some older young adult fiction by the same author as a one-book-reprint I had already upped my expectations by a chunky notch. 25 Books That Need To Be Made Into Movies Or Shows Posthaste Books Book Dragon Book Show.</p>
