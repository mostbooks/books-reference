<p><strong>Are We Not All Beggars Book Of Mormon</strong>, Because God is so generous with his forgiveness we also ought to be generous not just with our money but with our forgiveness. Instead we believe that this was a simple slip of the pen. I would recommend the entire chapter but the general concept is at least helpful. And behold even at this time ye have been calling on His name and begging for a remission of your sins.</p>

<p>Are We Not All Beggars. I think we can get some clarification by turning to Mosiah 4 in the Book of Mormon. 20 And behold even at this time ye have been calling on his name and begging for a remission of your sins. We do not hide the fact that we do not believe the Book of Mormon is an ancient text. Do we not all depend upon the same Being even God for all the substance which we have for both food and raiment and for gold and for silver and for all the riches which we have of every kind.</p>
