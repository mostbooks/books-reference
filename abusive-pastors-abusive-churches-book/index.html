<p>The kinds of experiences I relate are described in more detail in the forerunner to this book Churches That Abuse. Toxic Churches is good at explaining some of the problems but it doesnt do much to help folks whove been hurt to heal. I have tried to be selective in the details I relate about the abusive church experiences choosing those that seem to me to have the most profound influence on the process of a victims recovery. Others walk away more deeply wounded. There are few things more dangerous to a church than a pastor who manipulates his congregation.</p>
