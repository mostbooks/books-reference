<p><strong>Art As Therapy Book Review</strong>, Every day honest upright citizens leave highly respected museums and exhibitions feeling underwhelmed Its a scandal especially since the authors firmly believe art exists to make people better versions of themselves. Art as Therapy - Alain de Botton Art as Therapy There is widespread agreement that art is very important but it can be remarkably hard to say quite why. And if youve read other books by the co-author Alain de Botton then you will recognize his refreshing quips and wit peppered throughout this book even in the photo captions. For me this book is all of these things.</p>
