<p>Stanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family. For those who know an asshole or two after reading this book the list will grow. The novel called Holes by Louis Sachar mainly takes place at Camp Green Lake a detention center for boys. The book centers on Stanley Yelnats who is sent to Camp Green Lake a correctional boot camp in a desert in Texas after being falsely accused of theft. Sometimes when I start reading people arent quite sure if this is a humorous book or not and theyre not sure whether to laugh at first and then gradually people start laughing.</p>

<p>This channel discusses and reviews books novels and short stories through drawingpoorly. I think that the book is called holes firstly because the boys had to dig holes every day at Camp Green Lake because they were looking for something. The title of the book refers to holes the boys dig in the book. The novel called Holes by Louis Sachar mainly takes place at Camp Green Lake a detention center for boys.
