<p>A Book of Silence charts Maitlands journey towards a more silent life. Her marriage broke down and she began to live mostly alone. At around the age of fifty Maitlands circumstances changed. Her story culminates in her building a hermitage on an isolated moor in Galloway and as she guides readers through experiences of silence in this new home she evokes a sense of peace that includes the reader in its intimate tranquility. Maitland sets out from a place of loving concern full of tenderness for the human condition and hope that we might fulfill our best destinies.</p>
