<p>Andrew Ridgeley NEW BOOK Interview - George Michael and Me WHAMHear 100s of exclusive interviews and reviews by Alex Belfield at wwwcelebrityradiobiz - t. I wanted him to be happy But the era was less queer-friendly and Michael who had grown ferociously ambitious decided that coming out was a career risk he couldnt take. Today he is comfortable supremely well-adjusted and as anyone who has met him recently will attest displays a wide-open smile to the world you can see this in.

<p>Its a really interesting look into the music industry in the early 80s. Andrew gives us a love letter to Wham. Instead this is in more than one sense the biography of a friend. Today he is comfortable supremely well-adjusted and as anyone who has met him recently will attest displays a wide-open smile to the world you can see this in.
