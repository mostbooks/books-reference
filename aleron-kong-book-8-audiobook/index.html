<p>Ive been listening to the land series since book 1 and out of all the books this is one of the worst while Nick Podehl as always does a fantastic job of bringing the book to life Aleron Kong in my opinion has completely dropped the ball on this book after the previous 7 books this doesnt even come close to being on par with them it seems like his writing has become lazy with a heavy. I kind of wish I hadnt read this thread though. Kinda makes sense why the author hasnt updated us on the release date since its so far from when he promised but damn bro dont release it chapter by.
