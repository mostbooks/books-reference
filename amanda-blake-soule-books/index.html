<p><strong>Amanda Blake Soule Books</strong>, Amanda is the author of The Creative Family Handmade Home The Rhythm of Family and the Creative Family Manifesto all published by Roost BooksShe and her husband Steve live in the foothills of western Maine with their five children where they work together to bring back to life a 200 year old farmhouse and homestead. I really like her writing style perhaps its because I also firmly believe in what shes trying to convey how being creative with your children helps nurture family connections which is something sorely lacking in our society. In my younger days I was a writer and muscian more than anything while now it is the act of knitting to which I most often turn. Amanda Blake Soule of the blog SouleMama is a new discovery for me and I am so happy I found her books.</p>
