<p>The book Astoria is an unfolding adventure over the course of three years from 1810 to 1813 a tale of the harrowing times in American histo I have an interest in this time in American history and in the men who forged their names in history as the men who built America and John Jacob Astor is without doubt one of the most interesting men of this time. Astor later convinced Washington Irving one of the most important figures in nineteenth-century American literature to create a non-fiction account of the operations origins. In the tradition of The Lost City of Z and Skeleton in the Zahara Astoria is the thrilling true-adventure tale of the 1810 Astor Expedition an epic now forgotten three-year journey to forge an American empire on the Pacific Coast. Unfolding over the course of three years from 1810 to 1813 Astoria is a tale of high adventure and incredible hardship in the wilderness and at sea.</p>

<p>Account of John Jacob Astors attempt to found a commercial empire in the Pacific Northwest. In the tradition of The Lost City of Z and Skeletons in the Zahara Astoria is the thrilling true-adventure tale of the 1810 Astor Expedition an epic now forgotten three-year journey to forge an American empire on the Pacific Coast. While far less politics and far more high adventure Peter Starks Astoria does shed a fascinating light on the consequences of westward expansion in the years following the revolutionary war as entrepreneurs hoping to make their fortune focused on the massive natural resources of North America and the possibilities of controlling a global trade. Starks account of John Jacob Astors Astoria settlement on the west coast of the United States in the early 1800s is an amazing story of the journey of both sailors and explorers in crossing America whether by ship or canoe is spellbinding a book you wont put down. It was a private realm under the dominion of German-American entrepreneur John Jacob.</p>
