<p><strong>Acotar All Books</strong>, Its more or less me being confused as to why people call the acotar series spicy when literally most of the spice is just sexual tension the only book that is remotely spicy in the series is ACOSF. A set of 3 beautiful dust jackets inspired by The Shadow and Bone Trilogy. Although rereading the series is always an option here are 15 fantasy books like A Court of Thorns and Roses that hit on similar notes such as fairies magic romance and war and will keep you going until the next ACOTAR book. For those of you who dont know the name Sarah J.</p>
