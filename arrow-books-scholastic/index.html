<p><strong>Arrow Books Scholastic</strong>, The Arrow writers handbook. I know that Scholastic Book Services are still around these days I guess theyre more successful than ever what with their exclusive deal on the US-released Harry Potter books and allBut I can only hope they still have classroom book club operations going and that kids today are still getting excited about it. Since I believe Arrow still exists you may already know that it was part of the Scholastic Book Services and was aimed at kids in 4th 5th and 6th grades.
