<p>I originally started out watching Bones on FOX and I immediately loved it. See also the spin-off Bone. After a few episodes I realized that the show was based on a book series written by real-life forensic anthropologist Dr. My heroine and hero have a difficult road ahead of them and they will have to work hard to earn their HEA happily-ever-after so their story isnt over with the first book. Bones Series Kathy Reichs 206 Bones Bone Books.</p>
