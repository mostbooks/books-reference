<p><strong>A Woman Is No Man Book Ending Explained</strong>, Isra obviously suffers from worsening and untreated depression and she is treated brutally by those around her. A Woman is No Man is an ode to the power of literature highlighting the many ways art and imagination can change our life as if deep within ourselves lived a Sheherazade capable of taming our own sultan of despair and hopelessness. Id seen this book everywhere for a while now and was just drawn to it. The novel begins without a chapter heading or defined character - but a female voice explaining to the reader how I was born without a voice 1.</p>
