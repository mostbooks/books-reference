<p>This sweeping novel about fathers and sons the movie business and the changes that have shaped American culture follows Beau Rosenwald as he and his partner Williams Farquarsen helming the most successful agency in Hollywood fumble and thrive across the LA landscape. When purchasing a car from American dream machines I was just sure that their mechanic would go around and thoroughly inspect the car. Lynn Tom and the whole crew were super easy to work with throughout the process. Yes the books title telegraphs too much about Specktors theme.
