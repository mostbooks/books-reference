<p>American Psycho - MovieBook Project. Answer 1 of 4. The novels firm rejection of reliable knowledge is one reason why it is considered to be a literary example of postmodernism. American Psycho is Bret Easton Elliss third novel released in 1991. The story is told in the first person by Patrick Bateman a serial killer and Manhattan investment banker.</p>

<p>I dont think American Psycho can classified as a better anything as that would completely defeat its purpose. We take a look at American Psycho both the novel and film and see which one slays betterBe sure to leave a like a subscribe and follow us on TwitterTw. That being said I will say that watching Psycho is generally a more enjoyable experience than reading the book because of the work Stef and Hitch did on both Marion and Norman making them far more likable and empatheticspecifically with Marion whose motives are far more nuanced and rooted in love rather than tradition and with Norman who breaks the confines of the typical. When you read American Psycho its clear well before the book ends that Bateman is not actually a sadistic evil serial killer. A Film A Day Book Vs Movie American Psycho.</p>

<p>Its meant to show the absurdity of the degree of competition between these adult men who live and work in the prestige of upper class New York society and yet are also incredibly juvenile and silly to the point where they are comparing the minute details of business cards. What we do get is endless self absorbed ramblings inside his head about his inane life. American Psycho alternates seamlessly between reality and fantasy giving the reader few clues as to whether the events transpiring are imagined or not. At its core I believe that American Psycho is unlike the movie not a psychological thriller or horror book but rather a critisicm - a satire on the 1980s New York yuppie culture.

<p>American Psycho is Bret Easton Elliss third novel released in 1991. The purpose of the novel is to portray American culture in the 1980s as being so absurd and consumeristic that to read the novel is to engage in the same.
